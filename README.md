# RFID-Based-FASTAG-System
I designed an IoT based prototype of Highway/Freeway RFID based toll gate system. Toll gate opens on scanning of
the RFID and ensures thereâ€™s enough balance for the vehicle to pass. An IR sensor ensures the vehicle has passed
before letting the gate to close
Technologies Used - Hardware: EM18 RFID reader, RFID Card, Arduino Uno and Servo Motor
Software: Arduino IDE (Customized Java)
